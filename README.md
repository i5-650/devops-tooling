# DevOps Tooling

A small repository to gather my devops tools / config that I use.

## Env-dev

I often find myself working with a postgres and I don't want to set it up on my machine. Therefore, here is a postgresql + pgadmin already fully configured with it.
The idea is that you use `docker compose up`, and you have a postgresql and pgadmin to work on your apps.
You never need to enter a password, an address, or anything. You start it and it just works.
